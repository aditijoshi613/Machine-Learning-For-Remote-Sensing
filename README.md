In-class Kaggle Competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/gnr-638/overview

# Introduction
With the help of specially equipped sensors on the airborne devices or satellites, the remotely sensed images are being captured. It is very difficult to analyze these high resolution data by human eyes. Machine learning can help in resolving this problem. So, this in-class competition is to classify the remotely sensed images using deep learning architectures.

# Problem Statement
The task for this assignment is to test your designed neural network models for image classification problem. There are 7 classes: Basketball court, beach, forest,railway, tennis court, water pool, others.

# Submissions
For the given test samples, you need to submit a .csv file (with your roll number as the initials for eg. 0123456789.csv) that will contain your model's predictions.

The submitted file should contain the following:

ImageID, Label

For eg.

1001,2

1002,5

1003,1

1004,0

1005,3

and so on.

# Framework, language and libraries

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras and Tensorflow.
